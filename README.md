Ever been a student or know someone who is attending university?<br/>
Then you must be familiar with the difficulties that one faces when choosing a specialty to pursue.<br/>
</h3>
<h4 align="center">
After all, that decision might define the majority of one's career path. This problem also applies for the students of the South Mediterranean University.<br/><br/>
With lack of experience and knowledge about the different engineering fields, a MedTech student would want to seek guidance and help.<br/><br/>
Student Specialty Advisor is a free web app for the South Mediterranean University's community that aims to help the students pick the right specialty that suits them best.
